abstract: "The increase in industrial activities and the rapid urbanization of human populations had a terrible effect on global air quality. Thousands of factories and billions of vehicles release enormous amounts of pollutants into the air every day; dangerously affecting human health. Many epidemiological studies pointed out the responsibility of air pollution in many health issues, the reason why monitoring air quality became an obligation to prevent or limit these issues. Conventional systems based on measuring stations are expensive and offer low data granularity. As a result, researchers are increasingly targeting IoT-based systems. However, elaborating a new system for air quality monitoring requires an awareness of the state of the art and the mastery of a certain amount of specific knowledge (pollutants, their health effects, the sensing equipment, the IoT possible configuration,...). This paper aims to answer these necessities by reviewing the existing works on air quality monitoring using IoT with the focus on lasted trends and challenges."
